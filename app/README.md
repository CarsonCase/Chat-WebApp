# Chat App
My first time working with Svelte and pocketbase. Overall. Really cool stuff. Super easy to put together a working application. I'm following this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gUYBFDPZ5qk

# Instructions
1. run `../pocketbase` to run server
2. run `npm run dev` to start the frontend. And that's it!
```

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
